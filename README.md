# üîç Tron-Explorer

## üåü overview

tron-explorer is an intuitive and efficient tool for crawling and interpreting tron blockchain data. Whether it's locating a particular tron hash, identifying a specific block, or examining an account, tron-explorer offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to meet your needs.

Our goal is to empower developers and blockchain enthusiasts, particularly those new to evm-derivative blockchains, where simple, easy-to-follow resources may be scarce. By offering a solid introduction and walkthrough of tron, this project serves as a foundational stepping stone to understanding and working with the tron blockchain.

Please note, this project does not incorporate react-script and is specifically designed to demonstrate the back-end aspects of interacting with tron.
