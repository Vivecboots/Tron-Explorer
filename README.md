# üîç Tron-Explorer

## üåü overview

tron-explorer is an intuitive and efficient tool for crawling and interpreting tron blockchain data. Whether it's locating a particular tron hash, identifying a specific block, or examining an account, tron-explorer offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to meet your needs.

Our goal is to empower developers and blockchain enthusiasts, particularly those new to evm-derivative blockchains, where simple, easy-to-follow resources may be scarce. By offering a solid introduction and walkthrough of tron, this project serves as a foundational stepping stone to understanding and working with the tron blockchain.

Please note, this project does not incorporate react-script and is specifically designed to demonstrate the back-end aspects of interacting with tron.

## üí°Why I'm Doing This

Migrating from EVM and ZK EVM to TVM presented initial challenges, as expected when transitioning to a new environment. However, in smaller communities, it can be difficult to find answers to all your questions, making it harder to adapt to the new platform. This challenge is magnified when participating in a hackathon that caters to both amateurs and professionals.

To address this issue and support users facing similar problems, it is crucial to foster a sense of community. By inspiring and empowering builders, we can create an environment where newcomers feel encouraged rather than discouraged. Sharing experiences, providing guidance, and offering resources will help break down barriers and facilitate smoother transitions for new developers.

By actively contributing to community building efforts, we can ensure that knowledge is shared, questions are answered, and a supportive network is established. This will ultimately help newcomers overcome challenges, inspire innovation, and foster a collaborative environment for all participants.

Let's come together to inspire, educate, and create a thriving community where builders of all levels can thrive.
